# Event Limiter

Event limiter is a mod for Stardew Valley that allows for the configurable limitation of the amount of events seen by the player each day, and in a row. 
This can help with storyline immersion or in multiplayer where time continues during events. 
Skipped events will be played the next time they will trigger, provided an event limit has not been reached.
Hardcoded events (weddings) and PlayerKilled events won't be skipped.

Exclusions to which events are affected can also be configured. If there's a cutscene you never want skipped this can be done by listing its id in the Exceptions config option.

The mod does use Harmony, just FYI

Installation and use:
1. Download to mod here
2. Unzip the download file and place the EventLimiter folder in your Mods folder
3. Run the game at least once to generate the config
4. Edit the config as desired and enjoy!
